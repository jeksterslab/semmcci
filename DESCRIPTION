Description: Monte Carlo confidence intervals for free and defined parameters
    in models fitted in the structural equation modeling package lavaan
    can be generated using the semmcci package.
    The package has two main functions, namely, MC() and MCStd().
    The output of lavaan is passed as the first argument
    to the MC() function to generate Monte Carlo confidence intervals.
    Monte Carlo confidence intervals for the standardized estimates
    can also be generated by passing the output of the MC() function
    to the MCStd() function.
