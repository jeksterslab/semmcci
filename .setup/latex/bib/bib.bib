It is shown that $u - u_0 \exp( − \beta t )$ and $s − u_0 \beta [ 1 − \exp( − \beta t ) ]$ where $u_0$ is the initial velocity and $\beta$ the friction coefficient divided by the mass of the particle, follow the normal Gaussian distribution law. For $s$ this gives the exact frequency distribution corresponding to the exact formula for $s^2$ of Ornstein and Fürth. Discussion is given of the connection with the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation. By the same method exact expressions are obtained for the square of the deviation of a harmonically bound particle in Brownian motion as a function of the time and the initial deviation. Here the periodic, aperiodic and overdamped cases have to be treated separately. In the last case, when $\beta$ is much larger than the frequency and for values of $t >> \beta^{−1}$, the formula takes the form of that previously given by Smoluchowski.},

Professor C. C. Craig [1] has found the probability function of $z = xy/\sigma_1\sigma_2$ in closed form as the difference of two integrals. For purposes of numerical computation he has expanded this result in an infinite series involving powers of $z, \rho_1, \rho_2$, and Bessel functions of a certain type; in addition, he has determined the moments, semin-variants, and the moment generating function of $z$. However, for $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ large, as Craig points out, the series expansion converges very slowly. Even for $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ as small as 2, the expansion is unwieldy. We shall show that as $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2 \rightarrow \infty$, the probability function of $z$ approaches a normal curve and in case $r = 0$ the Type III function and the Gram-Charlier Type A series are excellent approximations to the $z$ distribution in the proper region. Numerical integration provides a substitute for the infinite series wherever the exact values of the probability function of $z$ are needed. Some extensions of the main theorem are given in section 5 and a practical problem involving the probability function of $z$ is solved.},

The case where x and y need not be independent is also studied, and exact variance formulas are presented for several different ``product estimates.''

  abstract = {Within the context of developmental psychology, longitudinal research is defined and reviewed from a historical perspective. Longitudinal research is shown always to include repeated-measurement methodology as the defining attribute, with individuals being the entity under study in developmental psychology. Additional characterizations vary, depending on historical and theoretical contexts. The need for longitudinal research was recognized at least as early as the nineteenth century. Terminology and specification of rationale, however, did not appear until the second or third decade of the twentieth century. The term longitudinal was initially identified in the context of age-based definitions of development. Recent decades, however, have seen an expansion of developmental theory beyond monolithic views to include age-irrelevant and multidirectional conceptions of the nature of development, particularly if a life-span perspective is taken. Such a pluralistic conception of behavioral development implies a more generic definition of longitudinal methodology than is associated with the traditional age-developmental view. Finally, it is important to recognize that the objective of longitudinal methodology is not only the descriptive identification of change. The objective includes explanatory goals also. Only recently has the unique strength of longitudinal research for explanatory efforts been recognized. In the second section of this chapter, a series of rationales for longitudinal research are outlined. These rationales are developed within the context of developmental psychology. They deal with (1) the direct identification of intraindividual change; (2) the identification of interindividual differences in intraindividual change; (3) the analysis of interrelationships in behavioral change; (4) the analysis of causes (determinants ) of intraindividual change; and (5) the analysis of causes (determinants) of interindividual differences in intraindividual change. In a third section, selected issues in longitudinal designs and analysis are briefly reviewed. The need for complex longitudinal designs and control groups is emphasized to help counteract the rather widespread assumption that simple longitudinal studies are invariably sufficient for answering developmental questions. Furthermore, general limitations on aspects of developmental research associated with the study of assigned variables such as age, sex, or cohort are outlined. These limitations place constraints on design purity and mandate the use of and familiarity with alternative quasi-experimental designs. As an example, some of the problems associated with causal analysis involving distal (delayed, mediated) influences and the use of lagged paradigms and causal modeling are discussed.},

Several classes of contamination were found, including tail weights from the uniform to the double exponential, exponential-level asymmetry, severe digit preferences, multimodalities, and modes external to the mean/median interval. Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions. A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.},

Advocates claim it is superior because it is not burdened by potentially unwarranted normal theory assumptions and because it retains information about the form of the original sample. Empirical support for its superiority, however, is quite limited. The present article compares the bootstrap and parametric approaches to estimating confidence intervals and Type I error rates of the correlation coefficient. The parametric approach is superior to the bootstrap under both assumption violation and nonviolation. The bootstrap results in overly restricted confidence intervals and overly liberal Type I error rates.},

Results in the literature provide a condition on the growth rate of the lag truncation parameter as $T \to \infty$ that is sufficient for consistency. No results are available, however, regarding the choice of lag truncation parameter for a fixed sample size, regarding data-dependent automatic lag truncation parameters, or regarding the choice of weighting scheme. In consequence, available estimators are not entirely operational and the relative merits of the estimators are unknown. This paper addresses these problems. The asymptotic truncated mean squared errors of estimators in a given class are determined and compared. Asymptotically optimal kernel/weighting scheme and bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are obtained using an asymptotic truncated mean squared error criterion. Using these results, data-dependent automatic bandwidth/lag truncation parameters are introduced. The finite sample properties of the estimators are analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation.},

Finite-sample or asymptotic results for the sampling distribution of estimators of direct effects are widely available. Statistical inferences about indirect effects have relied exclusively on asymptotic methods which assume that the limiting distribution of the estimator is normal, with a standard error derived from the delta method. We examine bootstrap procedures as another way to generate standard errors and confidence intervals and to estimate the sampling distributions of estimators of direct and indirect effects. We illustrate the classical and the bootstrap methods with three empirical examples. We find that in a moderately large sample, the bootstrap distribution of an estimator is close to that assumed with the classical and delta methods but that in small samples, there are some differences. Bootstrap methods provide a check on the classical and delta methods when the latter are applied under less than ideal conditions.},

For small $m$ our procedure's performance is largely governed by this coefficient of variation and the mean of these ratios. Using simulation techniques with small $m$, we compare our procedure's actual and nominal large-sample significance levels and conclude that it is essentially calibrated and thus represents a definite improvement over previously available procedures. Furthermore, we compare the large-sample power of the procedure as a function of $m$ and other factors, such as the dimensionality of the estimand and fraction of missing information, to provide guidance on the choice of the number of imputations; generally, we find the loss of power due to small $m$ to be quite modest in cases likely to occur in practice.},

Unlike the traditional ARIMA models, structural time series models consist explicitly of unobserved components, such as trends and seasonals, which have a direct interpretation. As a result the model selection methodology associated with structural models is much closer to econometric methodology. The link with econometrics is made even closer by the natural way in which the models can be extended to include explanatory variables and to cope with multivariate time series. From the technical point of view, state space models and the Kalman filter play a key role in the statistical treatment of structural time series models. The book includes a detailed treatment of the Kalman filter. This technique was originally developed in control engineering, but is becoming increasingly important in fields such as economics and operations research. This book is concerned primarily with modelling economic and social time series, and with addressing the special problems which the treatment of such series poses. The properties of the models and the methodological techniques used to select them are illustrated with various applications. These range from the modellling of trends and cycles in US macroeconomic time series to to an evaluation of the effects of seat belt legislation in the UK.},

  Analysis of Incomplete Multivariate Data helps bridge the gap between theory and practice, making these missing-data tools accessible to a broad audience. It presents a unified, Bayesian approach to the analysis of incomplete multivariate data, covering datasets in which the variables are continuous, categorical, or both. The focus is applied, where necessary, to help readers thoroughly understand the statistical properties of those methods, and the behavior of the accompanying algorithms.
  All techniques are illustrated with real data examples, with extended discussion and practical advice. All of the algorithms described in this book have been implemented by the author for general use in the statistical languages S and S Plus. The software is available free of charge on the Internet.},

Felsenstein suggested that bootstrapping be applied across characters of a taxon-by-character data matrix to produce replicate ``bootstrap data sets,'' each of which is then analyzed phylogenetically, with a consensus tree constructed to summarize the results of all replicates. The proportion of trees/replicates in which a grouping is recovered is presented as a measure of support for that group. Bootstrapping has become a common feature of phylogenetic analysis. However, the interpretation of bootstrap values remains open to discussion, and phylogeneticists have used these values in multiple ways. The usefulness of phylogenetic bootstrapping is potentially limited by a number of features, such as the size of the data matrix and the underlying assumptions of the phylogeny reconstruction program. Recent studies have explored the application of bootstrapping to large data sets and the relative performance of bootstrapping and jackknifing.},

Specifically, mediating models with 1 mediator, 2 intermediate mediators, 2 specific mediators, and 1 mediator in 2 independent groups are illustrated.

These included six Wald CIs, three bootstrap CIs, one likelihood-based CI, and the PRODCLIN CI.

In theory, MI and FIML are equivalent when identical models are tested using the same variables, and when m, the number of imputations performed with MI, approaches infinity. However, it is important to know how many imputations are necessary before MI and FIML are sufficiently equivalent in ways that are important to prevention scientists. MI theory suggests that small values of m, even on the order of three to five imputations, yield excellent results. Previous guidelines for sufficient m are based on relative efficiency, which involves the fraction of missing information ($\gamma$) for the parameter being estimated, and m. In the present study, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to test MI models across several scenarios in which $\gamma$ and m were varied. Standard errors and p-values for the regression coefficient of interest varied as a function of m, but not at the same rate as relative efficiency. Most importantly, statistical power for small effect sizes diminished as m became smaller, and the rate of this power falloff was much greater than predicted by changes in relative efficiency. Based our findings, we recommend that researchers using MI should perform many more imputations than previously considered sufficient. These recommendations are based on $\gamma$, and take into consideration one's tolerance for a preventable power falloff (compared to FIML) due to using too few imputations.},

Many combinations of parameters are used in the simulations to cover a wide range of situations in order to make the results more representative. The results of conducted simulations show that all three tests perform relatively well in stable VAR models without ARCH. In unstable VAR models the portmanteau test exhibits serious size distortions. LM and Rao tests perform well in unstable VAR models without ARCH. These results are true, irrespective of sample size or order of autocorrelation. Another clear result that the simulations show is that none of the tests have the correct size when ARCH is present irrespective of VAR models being stable or unstable and regardless of the sample size or order of autocorrelation. The portmanteau test appears to have slightly better power properties than the LM test in almost all scenarios.},

  abstract = {Understanding communication processes is the goal of most communication researchers. Rarely are we satisfied merely ascertaining whether messages have an effect on some outcome of focus in a specific context. Instead, we seek to understand how such effects come to be. What kinds of causal sequences does exposure to a message initiate? What are the causal pathways through which a message exerts its effect? And what role does communication play in the transmission of the effects of other variables over time and space? Numerous communication models attempt to describe the mechanism through which messages or other communication-related variables transmit their effects or intervene between two other variables in a causal model. The communication literature is replete with tests of such models.
  Over the years, methods used to test such process models have grown in sophistication. An example includes the rise of structural equation modeling (SEM), which allows investigators to examine how well a process model that links some focal variable X to some outcome Y through one or more intervening pathways fits the observed data. Yet frequently, the analytical choices communication researchers make when testing intervening variables models are out of step with advances made in the statistical methods literature. My goal here is to update the field on some of these new advances. While at it, I challenge some conventional wisdom and nudge the field toward a more modern way of thinking about the analysis of intervening variable effects.},

  abstract = {The sandwich estimator, also known as robust covariance matrix estimator, heteroscedasticity-consistent covariance matrix estimate, or empirical covariance matrix estimator, has achieved increasing use in the econometric literature as well as with the growing popularity of generalized estimating equations. Its virtue is that it provides consistent estimates of the covariance matrix for parameter estimates even when the fitted parametric model fails to hold or is not even specified. Surprisingly though, there has been little discussion of properties of the sandwich method other than consistency. We investigate the sandwich estimator in quasi-likelihood models asymptotically, and in the linear case analytically. We show that under certain circumstances when the quasi-likelihood model is correct, the sandwich estimate is often far more variable than the usual parametric variance estimate. The increased variance is a fixed feature of the method and the price that one pays to obtain consistency even when the parametric model fails or when there is heteroscedasticity. We show that the additional variability directly affects the coverage probability of confidence intervals constructed from sandwich variance estimates. In fact, the use of sandwich variance estimates combined with $t$-distribution quantiles gives confidence intervals with coverage probability falling below the nominal value. We propose an adjustment to compensate for this fact.},

In Study 1, confidence limits based on the distribution of the product are more accurate than methods based on an assumed normal distribution but confidence limits are still imbalanced.

Two additional common features in the imputation process are incorporated: restriction to a relevant subpopulation for some variables and logical bounds or constraints for the imputed values. The restrictions involve subsetting the sample individuals that satisfy certain criteria while fitting the regression models. The bounds involve drawing values from a truncated predictive distribution. The development of this method was partly motivated by the analysis of two data sets which are used as illustrations. The sequential regression procedure is applied to perform multiple imputation analysis for the two applied problems. The sampling properties of inferences from multiply imputed data sets created using the sequential regression method are evaluated through simulated data sets.},

  abstract = {Assessment in clinical psychology typically relies on global retrospective self-reports collected at research or clinic visits, which are limited by recall bias and are not well suited to address how behavior changes over time and across contexts. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects' current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects' natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects' lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.},

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

  abstract = {Survey and longitudinal studies in the social and behavioral sciences generally contain missing data. Mean and covariance structure models play an important role in analyzing such data. Two promising methods for dealing with missing data are a direct maximum-likelihood and a two-stage approach based on the unstructured mean and covariance estimates obtained by the EM-algorithm. Typical assumptions under these two methods are ignorable nonresponse and normality of data. However, data sets in social and behavioral sciences are seldom normal, and experience with these procedures indicates that normal theory based methods for nonnormal data very often lead to incorrect model evaluations. By dropping the normal distribution assumption, we develop more accurate procedures for model inference. Based on the theory of generalized estimating equations, a way to obtain consistent standard errors of the two-stage estimates is given. The asymptotic efficiencies of different estimators are compared under various assumptions. We also propose a minimum chi-square approach and show that the estimator obtained by this approach is asymptotically at least as efficient as the two likelihood-based estimators for either normal or nonnormal data. The major contribution of this paper is that for each estimator, we give a test statistic whose asymptotic distribution is chisquare as long as the underlying sampling distribution enjoys finite fourth-order moments. We also give a characterization for each of the two likelihood ratio test statistics when the underlying distribution is nonnormal. Modifications to the likelihood ratio statistics are also given. Our working assumption is that the missing data mechanism is missing completely at random. Examples and Monte Carlo studies indicate that, for commonly encountered nonnormal distributions, the procedures developed in this paper are quite reliable even for samples with missing data that are missing at random.},

  abstract = {Data described by econometric models typically contains autocorrelation and/or heteroskedasticity of unknown form and for inference in such models it is essential to use covariance matrix estimators that can consistently estimate the covariance of the model parameters. Hence, suitable heteroskedasticity consistent (HC) and heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent (HAC) estimators have been receiving attention in the econometric literature over the last 20 years. To apply these estimators in practice, an implementation is needed that preferably translates the conceptual properties of the underlying theoretical frameworks into computational tools. In this paper, such an implementation in the package sandwich in the R system for statistical computing is described and it is shown how the suggested functions provide reusable components that build on readily existing functionality and how they can be integrated easily into new inferential procedures or applications. The toolbox contained in sandwich is extremely flexible and comprehensive, including specific functions for the most important HC and HAC estimators from the econometric literature. Several real-world data sets are used to illustrate how the functionality can be integrated into applications.},

Applications from health, social, and developmental psychology, sociology, communication, exercise science, and epidemiology are emphasized throughout. Single-mediator, multilevel, and longitudinal models are reviewed. The author's goal is to help the reader apply mediation analysis to their own data and understand its limitations.
  Each chapter features an overview, numerous worked examples, a summary, and exercises (with answers to the odd numbered questions). The accompanying downloadable resources contain outputs described in the book from SAS, SPSS, LISREL, EQS, MPLUS, and CALIS, and a program to simulate the model. The notation used is consistent with existing literature on mediation in psychology.
  The book opens with a review of the types of research questions the mediation model addresses. Part II describes the estimation of mediation effects including assumptions, statistical tests, and the construction of confidence limits. Advanced models including mediation in path analysis, longitudinal models, multilevel data, categorical variables, and mediation in the context of moderation are then described. The book closes with a discussion of the limits of mediation analysis, additional approaches to identifying mediating variables, and future directions.
  Introduction to Statistical Mediation Analysis is intended for researchers and advanced students in health, social, clinical, and developmental psychology as well as communication, public health, nursing, epidemiology, and sociology. Some exposure to a graduate level research methods or statistics course is assumed. The overview of mediation analysis and the guidelines for conducting a mediation analysis will be appreciated by all readers.},

  abstract = {Theoretical models specifying indirect or mediated effects are common in the social sciences. An indirect effect exists when an independent variable's influence on the dependent variable is mediated through an intervening variable. Classic approaches to assessing such mediational hypotheses (Baron \& Kenny, 1986; Sobel, 1982) have in recent years been supplemented by computationally intensive methods such as bootstrapping, the distribution of the product methods, and hierarchical Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. These different approaches for assessing mediation are illustrated using data from Dunn, Biesanz, Human, and Finn (2007). However, little is known about how these methods perform relative to each other, particularly in more challenging situations, such as with data that are incomplete and/or nonnormal. This article presents an extensive Monte Carlo simulation evaluating a host of approaches for assessing mediation. We examine Type I error rates, power, and coverage. We study normal and nonnormal data as well as complete and incomplete data. In addition, we adapt a method, recently proposed in statistical literature, that does not rely on confidence intervals (CIs) to test the null hypothesis of no indirect effect. The results suggest that the new inferential method--the partial posterior p value--slightly outperforms existing ones in terms of maintaining Type I error rates while maximizing power, especially with incomplete data. Among confidence interval approaches, the bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) bootstrapping approach often has inflated Type I error rates and inconsistent coverage and is not recommended. In contrast, the bootstrapped percentile confidence interval and the hierarchical Bayesian MCMC method perform best overall, maintaining Type I error rates, exhibiting reasonable power, and producing stable and accurate coverage rates.},

The analysis concerned 693 distributions with a sample size ranging from 10 to 30. Measures of cognitive ability and of other psychological variables were included. The results showed that skewness ranged between -2.49 and 2.33. The values of kurtosis ranged between -1.92 and 7.41. Considering skewness and kurtosis together the results indicated that only 5.5\% of distributions were close to expected values under normality.

One particularly salient strength offered by longitudinal data is the ability to disaggregate between-person and within-person effects in the regression of an outcome on a time-varying covariate. However, the ability to disaggregate these effects has not been fully capitalized upon in many social science research applications. Two likely reasons for this omission are the general lack of discussion of disaggregating effects in the substantive literature and the need to overcome several remaining analytic challenges that limit existing quantitative methods used to isolate these effects in practice. This review explores both substantive and quantitative issues related to the disaggregation of effects over time, with a particular emphasis placed on the multilevel model. Existing analytic methods are reviewed, a general approach to the problem is proposed, and both the existing and proposed methods are demonstrated using several artificial data sets. Potential limitations and directions for future research are discussed, and recommendations for the disaggregation of effects in practice are offered.},

Using continuous time models (CTMs) rather than commonly employed discrete time models, one can estimate lag-independent parameters. We demonstrate methodology that allows for continuous time mediation analyses, with attention to concepts such as indirect and direct effects, partial mediation, the effect of lag, and the lags at which relations become maximal.

However, in this article, we characterize the relations of the DVAR model with its corresponding Structural Vector AR (SVAR) and Continuous Time Vector AR (CTVAR) models through a finite difference method across continuous and discrete time domain. We further clarify that the DVAR model of a continuous time, multivariate, linear Markov system is canonical under a highly generic condition. Our analysis shows that we can uniquely reproduce its SVAR and CTVAR models from the DVAR model. Based on these results, we propose a novel Continuous and Structural Vector Autoregressive (CSVAR) modeling approach to derive the SVAR and the CTVAR models from their DVAR model empirically derived from the observed time series of continuous time linear Markov systems.

  abstract = {The R statistical environment and language has demonstrated particular strengths for interactive development of statistical algorithms, as well as data modelling and visualisation. Its current implementation has an interpreter at its core which may result in a performance penalty in comparison to directly executing user algorithms in the native machine code of the host CPU. In contrast, the C++ language has no built-in visualisation capabilities, handling of linear algebra or even basic statistical algorithms; however, user programs are converted to high-performance machine code, ahead of execution. A new method avoids possible speed penalties in R by using the Rcpp extension package in conjunction with the Armadillo C++ matrix library. In addition to the inherent performance advantages of compiled code, Armadillo provides an easy-to-use template-based meta-programming framework, allowing the automatic pooling of several linear algebra operations into one, which in turn can lead to further speedups. With the aid of Rcpp and Armadillo, conversion of linear algebra centred algorithms from R to C++ becomes straightforward. The algorithms retain the overall structure as well as readability, all while maintaining a bidirectional link with the host R environment. Empirical timing comparisons of R and C++ implementations of a Kalman filtering algorithm indicate a speedup of several orders of magnitude.},

We describe the utility in three kinds of psychological data sets: data sets in which consecutive cases are assumed independent (e.g., cross-sectional data), temporally ordered data sets (e.g., n = 1 time series), and a mixture of the 2 (e.g., n > 1 time series). In time-series analysis, the GGM can be used to model the residual structure of a vector-autoregression analysis (VAR), also termed graphical VAR. Two network models can then be obtained: a temporal network and a contemporaneous network. When analyzing data from multiple subjects, a GGM can also be formed on the covariance structure of stationary means—the between-subjects network. We discuss the interpretation of these models and propose estimation methods to obtain these networks, which we implement in the R packages graphicalVAR and mlVAR. The methods are showcased in two empirical examples, and simulation studies on these methods are included in the supplementary materials.},

The first result is elevated Type I error rates for the bias-corrected and accelerated bias-corrected bootstrap tests not found in nonresampling tests or in resampling tests that did not include a bias correction. This is of special concern as the bias-corrected bootstrap is often recommended and used due to its higher statistical power compared with other tests. The second result is statistical power reaching an asymptote far below 1.0 and in some conditions even declining slightly as the size of the relationship between X and M, a, increased. Two computer simulations were conducted to examine these findings in greater detail. Results from the first simulation found that the increased Type I error rates for the bias-corrected and accelerated bias-corrected bootstrap are a function of an interaction between the size of the individual paths making up the mediated effect and the sample size, such that elevated Type I error rates occur when the sample size is small and the effect size of the nonzero path is medium or larger. Results from the second simulation found that stagnation and decreases in statistical power as a function of the effect size of the a path occurred primarily when the path between M and Y, b, was small. Two empirical mediation examples are provided using data from a steroid prevention and health promotion program aimed at high school football players (Athletes Training and Learning to Avoid Steroids; Goldberg et al., 1996), one to illustrate a possible Type I error for the bias-corrected bootstrap test and a second to illustrate a loss in power related to the size of a.

However, hurdles arise when using functional MRI data. Variation in ROI activity contains sequential dependencies and shared influences on synchronized activation. Consequently, both lagged and contemporaneous relationships must be considered for unbiased statistical parameter estimation. Identifying these relationships using a data-driven approach could guide theory-building regarding integrated processing. The present paper demonstrates how the unified SEM attends to both lagged and contemporaneous influences on ROI activity. Additionally, this paper offers an approach akin to Granger causality testing, Lagrange multiplier testing, for statistically identifying directional influence among ROIs and employs this approach using an automatic search procedure to arrive at the optimal model. Rationale for this equivalence is offered by explicating the formal relationships among path modeling, vector autoregression, and unified SEM. When applied to simulated data, biases in estimates which do not consider both lagged and contemporaneous paths become apparent. Finally, the use of unified SEM with the automatic search procedure is applied to an empirical data example.},

As a result, the lagged parameters that are obtained with the CLPM do not represent the actual within-person relationships over time, and this may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the presence, predominance, and sign of causal influences. In this article we present an alternative model that separates the within-person process from stable between-person differences through the inclusion of random intercepts, and we discuss how this model is related to existing structural equation models that include cross-lagged relationships. We derive the analytical relationship between the cross-lagged parameters from the CLPM and the alternative model, and use simulations to demonstrate the spurious results that may arise when using the CLPM to analyze data that include stable, trait-like individual differences. We also present a modeling strategy to avoid this pitfall and illustrate this using an empirical data set. The implications for both existing and future cross-lagged panel research are discussed.},

We found that tests agree much more frequently than they disagree, but disagreements are more common when an indirect effect exists than when it does not. We recommend the bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval as the most trustworthy test if power is of utmost concern, although it can be slightly liberal in some circumstances. Investigators concerned about Type I errors should choose the Monte Carlo confidence interval or the distribution-of-the-product approach, which rarely disagree.

With random predictors, this method also fails to account for the sampling variability of the predictor standard deviations. Nevertheless, under some conditions the standard method will produce CIs with accurate coverage rates. To delineate these conditions, we used a Monte Carlo simulation to compute empirical CI coverage rates in samples drawn from 36 populations with a wide range of data characteristics. We also computed the empirical CI coverage rates for 4 alternative methods that have been discussed in the literature: noncentrality interval estimation, the delta method, the percentile bootstrap, and the bias-corrected and accelerated bootstrap. Our results showed that for many data-parameter configurations--for example, sample size, predictor correlations, coefficient of determination ($R^2$), orientation of $\beta$ with respect to the eigenvectors of the predictor correlation matrix, $R_X$--the standard method produced coverage rates that were close to their expected values. However, when population $R^2$ was large 	and when $\beta$ approached the last eigenvector of $R_X$, then the standard method coverage rates were frequently below the nominal rate (sometimes by a considerable amount). In these conditions, the delta method and the 2 bootstrap procedures were consistently accurate. Results using noncentrality interval estimation were inconsistent. In light of these findings, we recommend that researchers use the delta method to evaluate the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},

Values of the critical ratio for each random variable are used to demonstrate how the moments of the distribution of the product change across values of the critical ratio observed in research studies. Results of the simulation study showed that as skewness in absolute value increases, coverage decreases. And as skewness in absolute value and kurtosis increases, imbalance increases. The difference between testing the significance of the indirect effect using the normal theory versus the asymmetric distribution of the product is further illustrated with a real data example. This article is the first study to show the direct link between the distribution of the product and indirect effect confidence intervals and clarifies the results of previous simulation studies by showing why normal theory confidence intervals for indirect effects are often less accurate than those obtained from the asymmetric distribution of the product or from resampling methods.},

Consequently, this can lead to researchers drawing conflicting conclusions regarding the sign and/or dominance of relationships. Multiple authors have suggested the use of continuous-time models to address this issue. In this article, we demonstrate the exact circumstances under which such conflicting conclusions occur. Specifically, we show that such conflicts are only avoided in general in the case of bivariate, stable, nonoscillating, first-order systems, when comparing models with uniform time-intervals between observations.

At stage 2, we impose appropriate linear equality constraints on the standardized model and use a likelihood ratio test to make statistical inferences about the equality of standardized coefficients. Unlike other existing methods for comparing standardized coefficients, the proposed method does not require specific modeling features (e.g., specification of nonlinear constraints), which are available only in certain SEM software programs. Moreover, this method allows researchers to compare two or more standardized coefficients simultaneously in a standard and convenient way.

Existing methods based on asymptotic theories (Olkin \& Finn, 1995) and bootstrapping (Chan, 2009) are available but these can only handle a 2-group comparison. Another method based on structural equation modeling (SEM) has been proposed recently. However, this method has three disadvantages. First, it requires the user to explicitly specify the sample R2 as a function in terms of the basic SEM model parameters, which is sometimes troublesome and error prone. Second, it requires the specification of nonlinear constraints, which is not available in some popular SEM software programs. Third, it is for a 2-group comparison primarily. In this article, a 2-stage SEM method is proposed as an alternative. Unlike all other existing methods, the proposed method is simple to use, and it does not require any specific programming features such as the specification of nonlinear constraints. More important, the method allows a simultaneous comparison of 3 or more groups. A real example is given to illustrate the proposed method using EQS, a popular SEM software program.},

In particular, cross-sectional analyses can imply the existence of a substantial indirect effect even when the true longitudinal indirect effect is zero. Thus, a variable that is found to be a strong mediator in a cross-sectional analysis may not be a mediator at all in a longitudinal analysis. In addition, we show that very different combinations of longitudinal parameter values can lead to essentially identical cross-sectional correlations, raising serious questions about the interpretability of cross-sectional mediation data.

  abstract = {In this article a continuous-time stochastic model (the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process) is presented to model the perpetually altering states of the core affect, which is a 2-dimensional concept underlying all our affective experiences. The process model that we propose can account for the temporal changes in core affect on the latent level. The key parameters of the model are the average position (also called home base), the variances and covariances of the process, and the regulatory mechanisms that keep the process in the vicinity of the average position. To account for individual differences, the model is extended hierarchically. A particularly novel contribution is that in principle all parameters of the stochastic process (not only the mean but also its variance and the regulatory parameters) are allowed to differ between individuals. In this way, the aim is to understand the affective dynamics of single individuals and at the same time investigate how these individuals differ from one another. The final model is a continuous-time state-space model for repeated measurement data taken at possibly irregular time points. Both time-invariant and time-varying covariates can be included to investigate sources of individual differences. As an illustration, the model is applied to a diary study measuring core affect repeatedly for several individuals (thereby generating intensive longitudinal data).},

  abstract = {Objective: Mediation models are used in prevention and intervention research to assess the mechanisms by which interventions influence outcomes. However, researchers may not investigate mediators in the absence of intervention effects on the primary outcome variable. There is emerging evidence that in some situations, tests of mediated effects can be statistically significant when the total intervention effect is not statistically significant. In addition, there are important conceptual and practical reasons for investigating mediation when the intervention effect is nonsignificant. Method: This article discusses the conditions under which mediation may be present when an intervention effect does not have a statistically significant effect and why mediation should always be considered important. Results: Mediation may be present in the following conditions: when the total and mediated effects are equal in value, when the mediated and direct effects have opposing signs, when mediated effects are equal across single and multiple-mediator models, and when specific mediated effects have opposing signs. Mediation should be conducted in every study because it provides the opportunity to test known and replicable mediators, to use mediators as an intervention manipulation check, and to address action and conceptual theory in intervention models. Conclusions: Mediators are central to intervention programs, and mediators should be investigated for the valuable information they provide about the success or failure of interventions.},

We investigated the methodological validity and statistical nature of both the current amputation practice and a newly developed and implemented multivariate amputation procedure. We found that the current way of practice may not be appropriate for the generation of intuitive and reliable missing data problems. The multivariate amputation procedure, on the other hand, generates reliable amputations and allows for a proper regulation of missing data problems. The procedure has additional features to generate any missing data scenario precisely as intended. Hence, the multivariate amputation procedure is an efficient method to accurately evaluate missing data methodology.},

Relatedly, growing research in EDs has explored the utility of ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) to target ED symptoms. The aims of the present review were to (1) synthesize recent literature pertaining to ambulatory assessment/EMA and EMI in EDs, and (2) identify relevant limitations and future directions in these domains. Recent Findings: With respect to ambulatory assessment and EMA, there has been substantial growth in the expansion of constructs assessed with EMA, the exploration of state- vs. trait-level processes, integration of objective and passive assessment approaches, and consideration of methodological issues. The EMI literature in EDs also continues to grow, though most of the recent research focuses on mobile health (mHealth) technologies with relatively minimal EMI components that adapt to momentary contextual information. Summary: Despite these encouraging advances, there remain several promising areas of ambulatory assessment research and clinical applications in EDs going forward. These include integration of passive data collection, use of EMA in treatment evaluation and design, evaluation of dynamic system processes, inclusion of diverse samples, and development and evaluation of adaptive, tailored EMIs such as just-in-time adaptive interventions. While much remains to be learned in each of these domains, the continual growth in mobile technology has potential to facilitate and refine our understanding of the nature of ED psychopathology and ultimately improve intervention approaches.},

Permutation tests work by rearranging data in many possible ways in order to estimate the sampling distribution for the test statistic.

A Monte Carlo simulation study was used to compare these four tests with the four best available tests for mediation found in previous research: the joint significance test, the distribution of the product test, and the percentile and bias-corrected bootstrap tests. We compared the different methods on Type I error, power, and confidence interval coverage. The noniterative permutation confidence interval for ab was the best performer among the new methods. It successfully controlled Type I error, had power nearly as good as the most powerful existing methods, and had better coverage than any existing method. The iterative permutation confidence interval for ab had lower power than do some existing methods, but it performed better than any other method in terms of coverage. The permutation confidence interval methods are recommended when estimating a confidence interval is a primary concern. SPSS and SAS macros that estimate these confidence intervals are provided.},

To test an indirect effect in a two-mediator model, we conducted a large-scale Monte Carlo simulation study of the Type I error, statistical power, and confidence interval coverage rates of 10 frequentist and Bayesian confidence/credible intervals (CIs) for normally and nonnormally distributed data. The simulation included never-studied methods and conditions (e.g., Bayesian CI with flat and weakly informative prior methods, two model-based bootstrap methods, and two nonnormality conditions) as well as understudied methods (e.g., profile-likelihood, Monte Carlo with maximum likelihood standard error [MC-ML] and robust standard error [MC-Robust]). The popular BC bootstrap showed inflated Type I error rates and CI under-coverage. We recommend different methods depending on the purpose of the analysis. For testing the null hypothesis of no mediation, we recommend MC-ML, profile-likelihood, and two Bayesian methods. To report a CI, if data has a multivariate normal distribution, we recommend MC-ML, profile-likelihood, and the two Bayesian methods; otherwise, for multivariate nonnormal data we recommend the percentile bootstrap. We argue that the best method for testing hypotheses is not necessarily the best method for CI construction, which is consistent with the findings we present.},

  abstract = {When designing longitudinal studies, researchers often aim at equal intervals. In practice, however, this goal is hardly ever met, with different time intervals between assessment waves and different time intervals between individuals being more the rule than the exception. One of the reasons for the introduction of continuous time models by means of structural equation modelling has been to deal with irregularly spaced assessment waves (e.g., Oud \& Delsing, 2010). In the present paper we extend the approach to individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes. In addition, we show not only that equal intervals are unnecessary but also that it can be advantageous to use unequal sampling intervals, in particular when the sampling rate is low. Two examples are provided to support our arguments. In the first example we compare a continuous time model of a bivariate coupled process with varying time intervals to a standard discrete time model to illustrate the importance of accounting for the exact time intervals. In the second example the effect of different sampling intervals on estimating a damped linear oscillator is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. We conclude that it is important to account for individually varying time intervals, and encourage researchers to conceive of longitudinal studies with different time intervals within and between individuals as an opportunity rather than a problem.},

Stochastic differential equations offer a solution to this problem by relating the discrete time model to its underlying model in continuous time. It is the goal of the present article to introduce this approach to a broader psychological audience.

We conduct simulations that examine both approaches and show that the most commonly used tests under the index approach risk inflated Type I errors compared with the joint-significance test inspired by the component approach. We argue that the tendency to report only a single mediational index is worrisome for this reason and also because it is often accompanied by a failure to critically examine the individual causal paths underlying the mediational model. We recommend testing individual components of the indirect effect to argue for the presence of an indirect effect and then using other recommended procedures to calculate the size of that effect. Beyond simple mediation, we show that our conclusions also apply in cases of within-participant mediation and moderated mediation.

  abstract = {In the domain of building and testing theory, mediation relationships are among the most important that can be proposed. Mediation helps to explicate our theoretical models (Leavitt, Mitchell, \& Peterson, 2010) and addresses the fundamental question of why two constructs are related (Whetten, 1989). One of the better-known methods for testing mediation is commonly referred to as the ``Sobel test,'' named for the researcher who derived a standard error (Sobel, 1982) to test the significance of the indirect effect. Recently, a number of different research teams (e.g., Preacher \& Hayes, 2004; Shrout \& Bolger, 2002) have criticized the Sobel test because this standard error requires an assumption of normality for the indirect effect sampling distribution. This distribution tends to be positively skewed (i.e,. not normal), particularly in small samples, and so this assumption can be problematic (Preacher \& Hayes, 2004; Stone \& Sobel, 1990). As a result, the statistical power of the Sobel test may be lessened in these contexts (Preacher \& Hayes 2004; Shrout \& Bolger, 2002). In light of this concern, some scholars have advocated instead for the use of bootstrapping to test the significance of the indirect effect (e.g.. Shrout \& Bolger 2002). Bootstrapping requires no a priori assumption about the shape of the sampling distribution because this distribution is empirically estimated using a resampling procedure (Efron \& Tibshirani, 1993). As a result, departures from normality are less troublesome when creating a confidence interval for the indirect effect. For this reason, bootstrapping is now widely believed to be inherently superior to the Sobel test when testing the significance of the indirect effect in organizational research. Our position is that this belief constitutes an urban legend. As with all statistical urban legends, there is an underlying kernel of truth to the belief that bootstrapping is superior to the Sobel test. However, as we discuss in this chapter, there are several reasons to be concerned with a broad belief in the superiority of bootstrapping. We begin with a brief overview of mediation testing focusing on the Sobel test and bootstrapping and then explain the underlying kernel of truth that has propelled bootstrapping to the forefront of mediation testing in organizational research. Subsequently, we discuss four areas of concern that cast doubt on the belief of the inherent superiority of bootstrapping. Finally, we conclude with recommendations concerning the future of mediation testing in organizational research.},

  abstract = {An up-to-date, comprehensive treatment of a classic text on missing data in statistics.
  The topic of missing data has gained considerable attention in recent decades. This new edition by two acknowledged experts on the subject offers an up-to-date account of practical methodology for handling missing data problems. Blending theory and application, authors Roderick Little and Donald Rubin review historical approaches to the subject and describe simple methods for multivariate analysis with missing values. They then provide a coherent theory for analysis of problems based on likelihoods derived from statistical models for the data and the missing data mechanism, and then they apply the theory to a wide range of important missing data problems.
  Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition starts by introducing readers to the subject and approaches toward solving it. It looks at the patterns and mechanisms that create the missing data, as well as a taxonomy of missing data. It then goes on to examine missing data in experiments, before discussing complete-case and available-case analysis, including weighting methods. The new edition expands its coverage to include recent work on topics such as nonresponse in sample surveys, causal inference, diagnostic methods, and sensitivity analysis, among a host of other topics.
  \begin{itemize} \item An updated ``classic'' written by renowned authorities on the subject \item Features over 150 exercises (including many new ones) \item Covers recent work on important methods like multiple imputation, robust alternatives to weighting, and Bayesian methods \item Revises previous topics based on past student feedback and class experience \item Contains an updated and expanded bibliography \end{itemize}
  The authors were awarded The Karl Pearson Prize in 2017 by the International Statistical Institute, for a research contribution that has had profound influence on statistical theory, methodology or applications. Their work ``has been no less than defining and transforming.'' (ISI)
  Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, Third Edition is an ideal textbook for upper undergraduate and/or beginning graduate level students of the subject. It is also an excellent source of information for applied statisticians and practitioners in government and industry.},

It takes the concept ot the likelihood as providing the best methods for unifying the demands of statistical modelling and the theory of inference. Every likelihood concept is illustrated by realistic examples, which are not compromised by computational problems. Examples range from a simile comparison of two accident rates, to complex studies that require generalised linear or semiparametric modelling.
  The emphasis is that the likelihood is not simply a device to produce an estimate, but an important tool for modelling. The book generally takes an informal approach, where most important results are established using heuristic arguments and motivated with realistic examples. With the currently available computing power, examples are not contrived to allow a closed analytical solution, and the book can concentrate on the statistical aspects of the data modelling. In addition to classical likelihood theory, the book covers many modern topics such as generalized linear models and mixed models, non parametric smoothing, robustness, the EM algorithm and empirical likelihood.},

  abstract = {Missing data pose challenges to real-life data analysis. Simple ad-hoc fixes, like deletion or mean imputation, only work under highly restrictive conditions, which are often not met in practice. Multiple imputation replaces each missing value by multiple plausible values. The variability between these replacements reflects our ignorance of the true (but missing) value. Each of the completed data set is then analyzed by standard methods, and the results are pooled to obtain unbiased estimates with correct confidence intervals. Multiple imputation is a general approach that also inspires novel solutions to old problems by reformulating the task at hand as a missing-data problem.
  This is the second edition of a popular book on multiple imputation, focused on explaining the application of methods through detailed worked examples using the MICE package as developed by the author. This new edition incorporates the recent developments in this fast-moving field.
  This class-tested book avoids mathematical and technical details as much as possible: formulas are accompanied by verbal statements that explain the formula in accessible terms.

  abstract = {Aims
  A mediator is a variable that explains the underlying mechanism between an independent variable and a dependent variable. The indirect effect indicates the effect from the predictor to the outcome variable via the mediator. In contrast, the direct effect represents the predictor's effort on the outcome variable after controlling for the mediator.
  Methods
  A single study rarely provides enough evidence to answer research questions in a particular domain. Replications are generally recommended as the gold standard to conduct scientific research. When a sufficient number of studies have been conducted addressing similar research questions, a meta-analysis can be used to synthesize those studies' findings.
  Results
  The main objective of this paper is to introduce two frameworks to integrating studies using mediation analysis. The first framework involves calculating standardized indirect effects and direct effects and conducting a multivariate meta-analysis on those effect sizes. The second one uses meta-analytic structural equation modeling to synthesize correlation matrices and fit mediation models on the average correlation matrix. We illustrate these procedures on a real dataset using the R statistical platform.
  Conclusion
  This paper closes with some further directions for future studies.},

The model partitions individuals’ data into two phases, known as regimes, with: (1) a zero-inflation regime that is used to accommodate high instances of zeros (non-drinking) and (2) a multilevel Poisson regression regime in which variations in individuals’ log-transformed average rates of alcohol use are captured by means of an autoregressive process with exogenous predictors and a person-specific intercept. The times at which individuals are in each regime are unknown, but may be estimated from the data. We assume that the regime indicator follows a first-order Markov process as related to exogenous predictors of interest. The forecast performance of the proposed model was evaluated using a Monte Carlo simulation study and further demonstrated using substance use and spatial covariate data from the Colorado Online Twin Study (CoTwins). Results showed that the proposed model yielded better forecast performance compared to a baseline model which predicted all cases as non-drinking and a reduced ZIMLP model without the RS structure, as indicated by higher AUC (the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) scores, and lower mean absolute errors (MAEs) and root-mean-square errors (RMSEs). The improvements in forecast performance were even more pronounced when we limited the comparisons to participants who showed at least one instance of transition to drinking. },

However, technological advances in data collection (e.g., smartphones, wearables) have led to a proliferation of short duration, densely collected longitudinal data in behavioral research. These intensive longitudinal data differ in structure and focus relative to traditionally collected panel data. As a result, existing methodological resources do not necessarily extend to nuances present in the recent influx of intensive longitudinal data and designs. In this tutorial, we first cover potential limitations of traditional longitudinal mediation models to accommodate unique characteristics of intensive longitudinal data. Then, we discuss how recently developed dynamic structural equation models (DSEMs) may be well-suited for mediation modeling with intensive longitudinal data and can overcome some of the limitations associated with traditional approaches. We describe four increasingly complex intensive longitudinal mediation models: (a) stationary models where the indirect effect is constant over time and people, (b) person-specific models where the indirect effect varies across people, (c) dynamic models where the indirect effect varies across time, and (d) cross-classified models where the indirect effect varies across both time and people. We apply each model to a running example featuring a mobile health intervention designed to improve health behavior of individuals with binge eating disorder. In each example, we provide annotated Mplus code and interpretation of the output to guide empirical researchers through mediation modeling with this increasingly popular type of longitudinal data.},

  doi = {10.3389/fpsyg.2020.571928},
  volume = {11},
  abstract = {A SEM-based approach using likelihood-based confidence interval (LBCI) has been proposed to form confidence intervals for unstandardized and standardized indirect effect in mediation models. However, when used with the maximum likelihood estimation, this approach requires that the variables are multivariate normally distributed. This can affect the LBCIs of unstandardized and standardized effect differently. In the present study, the robustness of this approach when the predictor is not normally distributed but the error terms are conditionally normal, which does not violate the distributional assumption of ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, is compared to four other approaches: nonparametric bootstrapping, two variants of LBCI, LBCI assuming the predictor is fixed (LBCI-Fixed-X) and LBCI based on ADF estimation (LBCI-ADF), and Monte Carlo. A simulation study was conducted using a simple mediation model and a serial mediation model, manipulating the distribution of the predictor. The Monte Carlo method performed worst among the methods. LBCI and LBCI-Fixed-X had suboptimal performance when the distributions had high kurtosis and the population indirect effects were medium to large. In some conditions, the problem was severe even when the sample size was large. LBCI-ADF and nonparametric bootstrapping had coverage probabilities close to the nominal value in nearly all conditions, although the coverage probabilities were still suboptimal for the serial mediation model when the sample size was small with respect to the model. Implications of these findings in the context of this special case of nonnormal data were discussed.},

  doi = {10.3758/s13428-023-02114-4},
  abstract = {Missing data is a common occurrence in mediation analysis. As a result, the methods used to construct confidence intervals around the indirect effect should consider missing data. Previous research has demonstrated that, for the indirect effect in data with complete cases, the Monte Carlo method performs as well as nonparametric bootstrap confidence intervals (see MacKinnon et al., Multivariate Behavioral Research, 39(1), 99–128, 2004; Preacher \& Selig, Communication Methods and Measures, 6(2), 77–98, 2012; Tofighi \& MacKinnon, Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 23(2), 194–205, 2015). In this manuscript, we propose a simple, fast, and accurate two-step approach for generating confidence intervals for the indirect effect, in the presence of missing data, based on the Monte Carlo method. In the first step, an appropriate method, for example, full-information maximum likelihood or multiple imputation, is used to estimate the parameters and their corresponding sampling variance-covariance matrix in a mediation model. In the second step, the sampling distribution of the indirect effect is simulated using estimates from the first step. A confidence interval is constructed from the resulting sampling distribution. A simulation study with various conditions is presented. Implications of the results for applied research are discussed.},

  abstract = {The multivariate delta method was used by Yuan and Chan to estimate standard errors and confidence intervals for standardized regression coefficients. Jones and Waller extended the earlier work to situations where data are nonnormal by utilizing Browne’s asymptotic distribution-free (ADF) theory. Furthermore, Dudgeon developed standard errors and confidence intervals, employing heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC) estimators, that are robust to nonnormality with better performance in smaller sample sizes compared to Jones and Waller’s ADF technique. Despite these advancements, empirical research has been slow to adopt these methodologies. This can be a result of the dearth of user-friendly software programs to put these techniques to use. We present the betaDelta and the betaSandwich packages in the R statistical software environment in this manuscript. Both the normal-theory approach and the ADF approach put forth by Yuan and Chan and Jones and Waller are implemented by the betaDelta package. The HC approach proposed by Dudgeon is implemented by the betaSandwich package. The use of the packages is demonstrated with an empirical example. We think the packages will enable applied researchers to accurately assess the sampling variability of standardized regression coefficients.},

It can be applied to many statistical problems, as a substitute to standard parametric approaches, or in situations for which parametric methods do not exist. In this Tutorial, we cover \texttt{R} code to implement the percentile bootstrap to make inferences about central tendency (e.g., means and trimmed means) and spread in a one-sample example and in an example comparing two independent groups. For each example, we explain how to derive a bootstrap distribution and how to get a confidence interval and a $p$ value from that distribution. We also demonstrate how to run a simulation to assess the behavior of the bootstrap. For some purposes, such as making inferences about the mean, the bootstrap performs poorly. But for other purposes, it is the only known method that works well over a broad range of situations. More broadly, combining the percentile bootstrap with robust estimators (i.e., estimators that are not overly sensitive to outliers) can help users gain a deeper understanding of their data than they would using conventional methods.},

Continuous-time (CT) models have been suggested as an alternative but require a conceptual shift, implying that DT-VAR parameters reflect total rather than direct effects. In this paper, we propose and illustrate a CT network approach using CT-VAR models. We define a new network representation and develop centrality measures which inform intervention targeting.

These computational options include whether the information matrix is observed or expected, whether the observed information matrix is estimated numerically or using an analytic asymptotic approximation, and whether the information matrix and the outer product matrix of the score vector are evaluated at the saturated or at the structured estimates. A variety of different standard errors and robust test statistics become possible by varying these options. We review the asymptotic properties of these computational variations, and we show how to obtain them using lavaan in R. We hope that this article will encourage methodologists to study the impact of the available computational options on the performance of standard errors and test statistics in SEM.},

  volume = {25},
  abstract = {Mediation analysis is an important approach for investigating causal pathways. One approach used in mediation analysis is the test of an indirect effect, which seeks to measure how the effect of an independent variable impacts an outcome variable through one or more mediators. However, in many situations the proposed tests of indirect effects, including popular confidence interval-based methods, tend to produce poor Type I error rates when mediation does not occur and, more generally, only allow dichotomous decisions of ``not significant'' or ``significant'' with regards to the statistical conclusion. To remedy these issues, we propose a new method, a likelihood ratio test (LRT), that uses non-linear constraints in what we term the model-based constrained optimization (MBCO) procedure. The MBCO procedure (a) offers a more robust Type I error rate than existing methods; (b) provides a p-value, which serves as a continuous measure of compatibility of data with the hypothesized null model (not just a dichotomous reject or fail-to-reject decision rule); (c) allows simple and complex hypotheses about mediation (i.e., one or more mediators; different mediational pathways), and (d) allows the mediation model to use observed or latent variables. The MBCO procedure is based on a structural equation modeling framework (even if latent variables are not specified) with specialized fitting routines, namely with the use of non-linear constraints. We advocate using the MBCO procedure to test hypotheses about an indirect effect in addition to reporting a confidence interval to capture uncertainty about the indirect effect because this combination transcends existing methods.},

For a widely used autoregressive mediation model, via analytical derivations, we explained why and how the conventionally reported time-specific coefficient estimates (e.g., $\hat{a} \hat{b}$ and $\hat{c}^{\prime}$ ) and inference results in AMM provide limited information and can arrive in even misleading conclusions about direct and indirect effects over time. Furthermore, under the stationarity assumption, we proposed an approach to calculate the overall direct and indirect effect estimates over time and the time lag lengths at which they reach maxima, using AMM results. The derivation results revealed that the overall direct and indirect effect curves are asymptotically invariant to the time interval selection, under stationarity. With finite samples and thus sampling errors and potential computing problems, however, our simulation results revealed that the overall indirect effect curves were better recovered when the time interval is selected to be closer to half of the time lag length at which the overall indirect effect reaches its maximum. An R function and an R Shiny app were developed to obtain the overall direct and indirect effect curves over time and facilitate the time interval selection using AMM results. Our findings provide another look at the connections between AMM and continuous time mediation modeling and the connections are discussed.},

  doi = {10.18637/jss.v095.i01},

  volume = {95},
  abstract = {Clustered covariances or clustered standard errors are very widely used to account for correlated or clustered data, especially in economics, political sciences, and other social sciences. They are employed to adjust the inference following estimation of a standard least-squares regression or generalized linear model estimated by maximum likelihood. Although many publications just refer to "the" clustered standard errors, there is a surprisingly wide variety of clustered covariances, particularly due to different flavors of bias corrections. Furthermore, while the linear regression model is certainly the most important application case, the same strategies can be employed in more general models (e.g., for zero-inflated, censored, or limited responses). In R, functions for covariances in clustered or panel models have been somewhat scattered or available only for certain modeling functions, notably the (generalized) linear regression model. In contrast, an object-oriented approach to ``robust''' covariance matrix estimation - applicable beyond lm() and glm() - is available in the sandwich package but has been limited to the case of cross-section or time series data. Starting with sandwich 2.4.0, this shortcoming has been corrected: Based on methods for two generic functions (estfun() and bread()), clustered and panel covariances are provided in vcovCL(), vcovPL(), and vcovPC(). Moreover, clustered bootstrap covariances are provided in vcovBS(), using model update() on bootstrap samples. These are directly applicable to models from packages including MASS, pscl, countreg, and betareg, among many others. Some empirical illustrations are provided as well as an assessment of the methods' performance in a simulation study.},
