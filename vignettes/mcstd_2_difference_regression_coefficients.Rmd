The Monte Carlo method is used to generate confidence intervals
for the difference of two standardized regression coefficients
in a multiple regression model.
The multiple regression model is given by

\begin{equation}
    Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \cdots + \beta_{j} X_{j} + \cdots + \beta_{p} X_{p} + \varepsilon, \quad j = \left\{ 1, 2, \cdots , p \right\}
\end{equation}

where $Y$ is the regressand variable, $X_{1} \cdots X_{j} \cdots X_{p}$ are the $p$ regressor variables, and $\varepsilon$ is the stochastic error term with expected value of zero and variance $\sigma^{2}$.

```

## Data

```{r}
n <- 1000
X1 <- rnorm(n = n)
X2 <- 0.50 * X1 + rnorm(n = n)
Y <- 0.25 * X1 + 0.50 * X2 + rnorm(n = n)
df <- data.frame(X1, X2, Y)
```

## Model Specification

We regress `Y` on `X1` and `X2`.
We label the regression coefficients as `beta1` and `beta2`.
We then specify the difference between the two coefficients
as `diff` using the `:=` operator.

```{r}
model <- "
  Y ~ beta1 * X1 + beta2 * X2
  diff := beta1 - beta2
"
```

## Model Fitting

We can now fit the model using the `sem()` function from `lavaan`.

> **Note:** We recommend setting `fixed.x = FALSE` when generating standardized estimates and confidence intervals to model the variances and covariances of the predictors if they are assumed to be random.

```{r}
fit <- sem(data = df, model = model, fixed.x = FALSE)
```

## Standardized Monte Carlo Confidence Intervals

Standardized Monte Carlo Confidence intervals,
including the difference between the standardized coefficients,
can be generated
by passing the result of the `MC()` function to the `MCStd()` function.

```{r}
MCStd(MC(fit, R = 20000L, alpha = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05)))
```
