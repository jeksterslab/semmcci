In this example, the Monte Carlo method is used to generate confidence intervals
for the indirect effects in a simple mediation model with latent variables.
`X`, `M`, and `Y` are latent variables with three indicators each
where `X` is the predictor, `M` is the mediator,
and `Y` is the dependent variable.

```{r}
#| message = FALSE
library(semmcci)
library(lavaan)
```

## Model Specification

The indirect effect is defined by the product of the slopes
of paths `X` to `M` labeled as `a` and `M` to `Y` labeled as `b`.
In this example, we are interested in the confidence intervals of `ab`
defined as the product of `a` and `b` using the `:=` operator
in the `lavaan` model syntax.

```{r}
model <- "
  X =~ x1 + x2 + x3
  M =~ x4 + x5 + x6
  Y =~ x7 + x8 + x9
  M ~ a * X
  Y ~ b * M
  ab := a * b
"
```

## Model Fitting

We can now fit the model using the `sem()` function from `lavaan` using the Holzinger and Swineford (1939) data set.

```{r}
data <- lavaan::HolzingerSwineford1939
fit <- sem(data = data, model = model)
```

## Monte Carlo Confidence Intervals

The `fit` `lavaan` object can then be passed to the `MC()` function from `semmcci`
to generate Monte Carlo confidence intervals.

```{r}
MC(fit, R = 20000L, alpha = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05))
```

## Standardized Monte Carlo Confidence Intervals

Standardized Monte Carlo Confidence intervals can be generated by passing the result of the `MC()` function to `MCStd()`.

> **Note:** We recommend setting `fixed.x = FALSE` when generating standardized estimates and confidence intervals to model the variances and covariances of the predictors if they are assumed to be random.

```{r}
fit <- sem(data = data, model = model, fixed.x = FALSE)
unstd <- MC(fit, R = 20000L, alpha = c(0.001, 0.01, 0.05))
```

```{r}
MCStd(unstd)
```
